# WPR proto 0 (Commit0)

WPR is a WP7-8 XNA app runner.

## Features

- Installing WP7-8 **decrypted** XNA XAPs locally on your machine.
- Only 1 platform (Windows Desktop) and only special test app preset (c:\temp\ must have "Morter.Game" and so on...)
    
## 2 words about this runner existence

- It's for fun. If you are nostaglia mostly about achievements earning like me, you can try it out. There are some old games that is not released on Android or iOS, or some games that seems superior than Android or iOS version (I prefer Skulls of the Shogun on WP actually).
- However, resolution scaling is not yet implemented (game renders either in 480x800 or so...), but it's fun!
